[00:00.00]a million bucks on a queen motel beed - Eric Hutchinson
[00:22.42]Okay I brought some back from Colorado just to see
[00:27.54]If on the nights you're working late I can set myself free
[00:32.50]I'm getting oh so horizontal Netflix on TV
[00:37.81]Feeling good
[00:43.68]There's nothing else to do but
[00:46.18]Follow up this hunch
[00:48.89]By the time you come home
[00:51.63]I'll be out to lunch
[00:55.96]I'm a million bucks on a queen motel bed
[01:01.39]I'm the king of France and it's off with my head
[01:06.21]I'm up so high it feels like nothing's even happening
[01:11.17]I'll spark the sky and let the windows get to rapping
[01:16.74]Maybe tomorrow I will finally finish laughing
[01:26.92]I never noticed how the floor can shimmer in this light
[01:31.90]And now I'm hungry but don't really want an appetite
[01:37.20]You know the wolfman told me to be careful love can bite
[01:42.90]And it hurts
[01:48.32]Somebody change the channel
[01:51.01]Everything's the same
