[00:00.00]What Do I Know? - Ed Sheeran
[00:00.56]Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon 
[00:03.54]But God gave me a stage a guitar and a song 
[00:07.83]My daddy told me son don't you get involved 
[00:12.05]In politics religions other peoples' quarrels 
[00:17.18]I'll paint the picture let me set the scene 
[00:20.44]I know when I have children they will know what it means 
[00:24.53]And I'll pass on the things my family's given to me 
[00:28.66]Just love and understanding positivity 
[00:33.16]We could change this whole world with a piano 
[00:36.91]Add a bass some guitar grab a beat and away we go 
[00:42.14]I'm just a boy with a one man show 
[00:45.24]No university no degree but Lord knows 
[00:50.02]Everybody's talking about exponential growth 
[00:53.61]And the stock market crashing and their portfolios 
[00:57.93]While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote 
[01:01.98]Saying love could change the world in a moment 
[01:05.62]But what do I know 
[01:10.97]Love can change the world in a moment 
[01:14.02]But what do I know 
[01:19.34]Love can change the world in a moment 
[01:23.58]The revolution's coming it's a minute away 
[01:27.03]I saw people marching in the streets today 
[01:32.30]You know we are made up of love and hate 
[01:35.34]But both of them are balanced on a razor blade 
[01:40.70]I'll paint the picture let me set the scene 
[01:43.95]I know I'm all for people following their dreams 
[01:47.99]Just remember life is more than fitting in your jeans 
[01:52.08]It's love and understanding positivity 
[01:56.62]We could change this whole world with a piano 
[02:00.38]Add a bass some guitar grab a beat and away we go 
[02:05.58]I'm just a boy with a one man show 
[02:08.66]No university no degree but Lord knows 
[02:13.47]Everybody's talking about exponential growth 
[02:17.08]And the stock market crashing and their portfolios 
[02:21.38]While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote 
[02:25.46]Saying love could change the world in a moment 
[02:29.09]But what do I know 
[02:34.45]Love can change the world in a moment 
[02:37.46]But what do I know 
[02:42.80]Love can change the world in a moment 
[02:47.51]I'll paint the picture let me set the scene 
[02:50.70]You know the future's in the hands of you and me 
[02:54.75]So let's all get together we can all be free 
[02:58.80]Spread love and understanding positivity 
[03:03.41]We could change this whole world with a piano 
[03:07.17]Add a bass some guitar grab a beat and away we go 
[03:12.38]I'm just a boy with a one man show 
[03:15.48]No university no degree but Lord knows 
[03:20.23]Everybody's talking about exponential growth 
[03:23.85]And the stock market crashing and their portfolios 
[03:28.19]While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote 
[03:32.20]Saying love could change the world in a moment 
[03:35.89]But what do I know 
[03:41.24]Love can change the world in a moment 
[03:44.23]But what do I know 
[03:49.58]Love can change the world in a moment 
[03:52.58]But what do I know
