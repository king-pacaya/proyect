[00:06.93]Back then is where your heart is

[00:33.62]You really miss those humid summer days
[00:43.59]And again and again and again you're staring backwards

[00:58.53]And again and again and again you're staring backwards
[01:05.90]There's nothing back then, nothing back then

[02:02.65]And again and again and again you're staring backwards
[02:10.04]There's nothing back then, nothing back then
