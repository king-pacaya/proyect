[00:00.00]Castle on the Hill - Ed Sheeran  
[00:08.13]When I was six years old I broke my leg 
[00:15.09]I was running from my brother and his friends 
[00:22.23]Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down 
[00:29.37]I was younger then take me back to when 
[00:35.12]I found my heart and broke it here 
[00:39.55]Made my friends and lost them through the years 
[00:43.65]And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long I know I've grown 
[00:50.81]But I can't wait to go home 
[00:53.60]I'm on my way driving at 90 down those country lanes 
[01:04.09]Singing to Tiny Dancer 
[01:07.56]And I miss the way you make me feel it's real 
[01:14.73]We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill 
[01:26.22]15 years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes 
[01:33.30]Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends 
[01:40.18]Had my first kiss on a Friday night 
[01:43.99]I don't reckon I did it right 
[01:47.21]I was younger then take me back to when 
[01:52.92]We found weekend jobs when we got paid 
[01:58.08]We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight 
[02:01.78]Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long oh how we've grown 
[02:08.81]I can't wait to go home 
[02:11.83]I'm on my way driving at 90 down those country lanes 
[02:22.31]Singing to Tiny Dancer 
[02:25.76]And I miss the way you make me feel it's real 
[02:32.98]We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill 
[02:43.55]Over the castle on the hill 
[02:50.72]Over the castle on the hill 
[03:02.27]One friend left to sell clothes one works down by the coast 
[03:09.12]One had two kids but lives alone one's brother overdosed 
[03:16.47]One's already on his second wife one's just barely getting by 
[03:22.90]But these people raised me and I can't wait to go home 
[03:29.81]And I'm on my way I still remember these old country lanes 
[03:40.19]When we did not know the answers 
[03:44.01]And I miss the way you make me feel it's real 
[03:51.20]We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill 
[04:01.75]Over the castle on the hill 
[04:08.86]Over the castle on the hill
